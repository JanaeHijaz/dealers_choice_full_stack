Setting up Routers:

1. Import react-router-dom
2. import { HashRouter, Route } from 'react-router-dom' on Main component and other components 
3. add <HashRouter> </HashRouter> around the App and Provider
    - you should immediately start seeing the '#' symbol in your URL. If not, you've got a problem.
4. Go into relevant Component(s) and add a link tag around data (item.length for example):
    - syntax: <Link to='/url'> STUFF HERE YOU WANT TO DISPLAY AS A LINK </Link>
5. Go back to main component that has all components, and change the component that you added a route to, to: <Route path='/url' component={ COMPONENT NAME } />
